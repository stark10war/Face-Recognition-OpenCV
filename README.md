# Face-Recognition-OpenCV

1. The generate_train_samples.py file generates train sample face from your webcam. Run the script and Enter your name in the consol. Press 'C' to capture the images.
   After 20 Images are captured the camera window will close automaticly and the faces will be saved a folder of your name inside the 'Input_images'folder.

2. Then Run the Training_script.py file to train the OpenCV pre built face classifier model to train for the samples generated.

3. Finally run the facedetection_video.py file to launch teh camera window to detect faces in realtime.

>>>> please Remember to change the working directory in all the scripts to the directory where the scripts as well as all the files are saved i.e the folder of the cloded repository<<<

Thanks.
